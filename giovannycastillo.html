    Hello, my name is Giovanny Castillo, I am born and rasied in Chicago, IL. My family is from Guatemala, they immigrated here in the United States. My favorite sport in baseball,
    I am a huge Chicago Cubs fan. I am analytical, observer, driven, and good with collaboration. I am current intern for IC Stars, I hope to gain some 
    experience in coding and develop soft skills, and leadership skills to prepare myself in the Tech field as a career.
</p>

    Also, some activites I like to do is attend a comic book convention, Chicago hosts a convention yearly called, C2E2, Chicago Comic and Entertainment Expo.
    I often exercise, especially jogging around the park to stay ative, clear my mind, and enjoy the outside weather. My favoitre season is summer, I try to 
    enjoy it by going out as much as possible, explore around the city of Chicago, go to new resturants, go to the beach, or going to events. If I have time, I attend socials where
    I can dance salsa or bachata. On my free time, I can be gamer, I play many different types of games, more of a PlayStation guy, but slowly transitioning to PC with the steam application.

    How I go into collecting comics is when I was little I watched alot of animation shows from either Marvel or DC. I was fascinated by the superheroes
    I wanted to read comics, however did not have the money to buy them and there were no comic stores near me. Years later, when I attended college, I had an acquitane
    who also reads and collects comics, told my about a convention relating to comics, and it got me interested in attending. At the convention, I saw many comics be sold 
    at almost every vendor, there I started look for Shazam comics, which is my favorite superhero. From there, I starte to reseearch issues, trade paperbacks, and locations of comic books.
    Since then, I continued to collect comic books when I am able to.
